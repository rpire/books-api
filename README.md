# Books API (Books Back-End)

The Books API is, as its name states, an API that lets you interact with a database of *users* and *books*. The `API` gives you access to a vast number of actions that can be performed in the database, like registering as a new user, logging in, creating new books, and updating their information. For now, this project is not deployed and thus more extensive documentation on the Books API is currently unavailable but it can be used by forking this repository and running it locally.
